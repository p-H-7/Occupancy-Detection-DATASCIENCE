# Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier
Used the Occupancy Detection Data Set for training the SVM task. 

The dataset contains experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy) from Temperature, Humidity, Light and CO2 of 8143 instances described by 7 attributes. 

Our task was to use several dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the feature dimension of data and then train Support Vector Machines.

The report contains a brief overview of our approach and the results we obtained in the process.
